# Connect Four

## History

_June 2004_ Connect Four was my capstone project to complete my Honors Diploma at Vestal High Scool.

Somehow in college, I lost track of the source, only maintaining the .class files to run it as an applet on my webserver.  Today, in 2015, running Java applets in the browser is no longer feasible, so I grabbed [JD](http://jd.benow.ca/), a Java decompiler to decompile the source in an attempt to get it running again.  That succeeded.

## Usage
I wrote this using [BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org/), long before I understood IDEs, packages, or source control. All you need to get going is a java install and two commands:

```bash
javac *.java
java Play_Connect_Four
```
